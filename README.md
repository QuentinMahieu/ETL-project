# ETL Project

## How SAFE are you?

We hear everyday on the news different types of crimes happening. 
But what is happening in your country?
What are the facts and how safe are we walking at night nowadays?
Can we find some explanations for the high or low crime rates?

The project consist by collecting the crime rate and prison population figures for every country on the world.
We want to collect country informations such as GDP, size, latitude, longitude, density, med age, fertility and hapiness.
Once collected we could compare the countries to find a pattern.

We also want to collect crime informations more specifically for Australia

As a bonus, we will collect drug seizure informations for every coutry. 
We would like to have an idea how import crimes are in every country.
