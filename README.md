## How SAFE is your country

We hear everyday on the news different types of crimes happening. 
But what is happening in your country?
What are the facts and how safe are we walking at night nowadays?

The project consist by collecting criminal figures all around the world. 
We want to be able to compare by country :

  - crime rate
  - prisons figures
  
We want to go a step further and collect informations about drug and murder crimes around the word :

  - murder rates
  - drug rates

We would like to end this ETL project by collecting informations about the most famous criminals so far:
  
  - names
