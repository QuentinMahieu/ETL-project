## How SAFE is your country

We hear everyday on the news different types of crimes happening. 
But what is happening in your country?
What are the facts and how safe are we walking at night nowadays?

The project consist by sharing criminal figures all around the world. 
We want to be able to compare by country :
  - crime rate
  - crime types
  - criminal figures
  - prisons figures
  - frequency of crimes
